      <h2>How did I end up at WeThinkCode</h2>
      <p>
        I am thrilled to share my journey from being a dedicated teacher to venturing into the dynamic 
        world of software development.

        For years, I had the privilege of shaping young minds as an educator, witnessing the 
        transformative power of education. 
        However, my thirst for knowledge and a desire to provide my students with the best possible 
        opportunities 
        led me on an exciting path towards embracing technology as a catalyst for change.
        
        Through extensive research and self-exploration, I discovered my love for the endless 
        possibilities that technology offers in the realm of education. It was a revelation that 
        opened my eyes to a world of innovation and growth. Eager to expand my skill set, I took 
        a leap of faith and joined We Think Code, a premier coding campus renowned for its practical 
        approach and emphasis on real-world problem-solving.
        
        My time at We Think Code has been nothing short of extraordinary. 
        Engaging in hands-on experiences, collaborating with diverse peers, 
        and immersing myself in coding challenges have not only sharpened my 
        software development skills but also enhanced my ability to think critically and adapt 
        to fast-paced environments.
        
        As I embark on the final year of my studies, I am excited to apply the knowledge 
        I have gained to make a significant impact in the software development industry. 
        My goal is to bridge the gap between education and technology, leveraging the power of 
        innovative software solutions to empower learners and revolutionize traditional teaching methods.
        
        I am an enthusiastic learner, continuously exploring new technologies and staying 
        up-to-date with the latest trends in the ever-evolving software development landscape.
        With a growth mindset and a passion for lifelong learning, I am confident 
        in my ability to contribute meaningfully to the field of software development.
